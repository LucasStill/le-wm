# OrailixTower AR-LSTM le-wm results — auto-updated

Scenario-4 TurboSens, AR-LSTM baseline, 10 epochs each, bf16-mixed,
AdamW lr=7e-5 cosine, hi_probe at epoch 5 + final epoch.

Predictor: `LSTMPredictor(hidden_dim=256, num_layers=2, dropout=0.1)`.
Everything else identical to dragon's JEPA config — see `identity.md`.

(Empty rows fill in as runs complete. Param count is the same across
all four because H, S, P do not affect any module's `nn.Parameter`s —
they only change the AR-rollout depth and dataloader windowing.)

**Param-count parity note** (per dragon's reply 2026-04-25 09:34Z):
my AR-LSTM at `hidden=256, layers=2` is **1.138 M trainable params**
vs dragon's JEPA encoder-only **0.828 M** quoted in their campaign
report — a **+37 %** delta. Dragon and I agreed to *not* calibrate to
exact parity (cost: ~1 h GPU for marginal value). The paper text
should call this out explicitly so reviewers don't conflate predictor
choice with model size. Concrete mitigation: report final per-config
total-param counts alongside metrics in the paper table.

## Key findings so far (after L1 + L2)

1. **AR-LSTM training loss is consistently lower than JEPA's** at the
   matched H:
   - L1 (H=16) fit/pred=0.129 vs E1 fit/pred=0.152 (LSTM 15 % lower)
   - L2 (H=32) fit/pred=0.078 vs E2 fit/pred=0.076 (essentially equal)
   So at H=16 the LSTM has a real advantage on the world-modeling
   objective; at H=32 the two architectures converge. With +37 % LSTM
   params, this isn't free — the H=16 gap may shrink under size-matched
   comparison (dragon's E1' run is in the planning note).

2. **Probe Pearson degrades with H for BOTH architectures**, confirming
   the trend dragon flagged is not predictor-specific. Pearson @9:
   - LSTM: L1 0.242 → L2 0.169 (-30 %)
   - JEPA: E1 0.25  → E2 0.18  (-28 %)
   Almost identical drop — this is a property of the H=16 vs H=32
   *training task*, not the architecture. **Major paper-worthy finding.**

3. **Non-monotonic-in-epoch pattern is mixed**: at H=16 the LSTM's
   epoch-9 beats epoch-5 (0.242 > 0.224); at H=32 it flips to match
   the JEPA pattern (epoch-5 0.188 > epoch-9 0.169). So both
   architectures show degradation from epoch-5 to epoch-9 at H=32.
   Suggests the H=32 task encourages representations that drift away
   from HI-relevant features over training — independent of predictor.

4. **Action-RUL is noise for all four runs** (LSTM L1, L2 and JEPA E1,
   E2; R² ≈ -0.12 to -0.15, Pearson ≈ 0 to 0.03). Confirms 10 epochs
   is not enough for RUL regardless of architecture or H.
